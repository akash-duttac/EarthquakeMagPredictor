# EarthquakeMagPredictor
Project for Semester 8 - KIIT (CSE)
# Earthquake Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting earthquake magnitudes using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Two different models were implemented:
1. Traditional machine learning models such as **Linear Regression, SVM, and Random Forest**.
2. A **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to forecast earthquake magnitudes based on historical seismic data.

The datasets used for this project were sourced from:
- **Dataset for traditional models**: [SOCR Data: California Earthquake Data](https://socr.ucla.edu/docs/resources/SOCR_Data/SOCR_Data_Earthquakes_Over3.html)
- **Dataset for LSTM Model**: [IRIS Seismic Data](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/)

## Notebook 1: Traditional Machine Learning Models
### Data Preprocessing:
- The dataset was loaded and preprocessed (handling missing values, normalizing magnitudes and depth).
- Time-ordered splitting (80% training, 20% testing) was applied.

### Models Implemented:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

## Notebook 2: Deep Learning with LSTM
### Data Preprocessing:
- The dataset was processed similarly to Notebook 1.
- An LSTM-based sequence model was built to predict earthquake magnitudes.

### Model Architecture:
- **LSTM Layers**: Two stacked LSTM layers.
- **Dense Layer**: Fully connected layer for magnitude prediction.
- **Concatenation**: Merging depth information with LSTM output.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Optimizer**: Adam.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using `keras_tuner`.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations:
- **Actual vs Predicted Magnitudes**: Scatter and trend plots comparing real and predicted values.
- **Prediction Error Analysis**: Line plots showing prediction errors.

# **Final Model Rankings for Earthquake Prediction**

Based on **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R¬≤ Score**, here are the final results:

| **Model**             | **MSE**   | **R¬≤ Score**    | **Ranking (Best to Worst)** |
|-----------------------|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Random Forest**     | **0.0126**   | **-0.1832**    | ü•á (Best) |
| **Na√Øve Bayes**       | **0.0174**   | **-0.6337**    | ü•à (Surprisingly strong) |
| **Decision Tree**     | **0.0287**   | **-1.6939**    | ü•â (Overfitting detected) |
| **Linear Regression** | **0.1879**   | **0.0235**     | üèÖ (Decent for simple cases) |
| **LSTM (Deep Learning)** | **0.9675**   | *N/A*        | üöß (Potential, but underperforms) |
| **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** | **0.6981**   | **-2.6273**   | ‚ùå (Worst performance) |

## **Analysis & Conclusion**
### **üèÜ Random Forest is the Best Model**
- It has the **lowest MSE (0.0126)** and the **highest R¬≤ (-0.1832)**.
- Handles **non-linear relationships** well and prevents **overfitting** by using multiple decision trees.

### **üìà Na√Øve Bayes Performs Surprisingly Well**
- Despite being a simple probabilistic model, its **MSE (0.0174)** is better than Decision Trees and even Linear Regression!
- This suggests that **categorical classification of earthquake magnitudes may work well** with a probabilistic approach.

### **üå≥ Decision Tree Shows Overfitting**
- Its **MSE (0.0287)** is higher than Na√Øve Bayes and RF, and **R¬≤ (-1.6939)** indicates a poor fit.
- This suggests **overfitting**, meaning the tree is memorizing the training data instead of generalizing well.

### **üìâ Linear Regression is Decent**
- **MSE (0.1879)** is high, but its **R¬≤ (0.0235)** is **better than Decision Trees and SVM**.
- Works for simple linear relationships, but earthquakes are highly non-linear!

### **ü§ñ LSTM Needs Improvement**
- **MSE (0.9675)** is the highest, meaning it struggled to make accurate predictions.
- This suggests that **deep learning needs more data, better tuning, or alternative architectures** (e.g., CNN-LSTM).

### **‚ùå SVM is the Worst Model**
- **MSE (0.6981)** and **R¬≤ (-2.6273)** are terrible.
- This confirms that **SVM is not suitable for earthquake magnitude prediction**.

## **Final Recommendation**
üöÄ **For the best performance, use Random Forest.**  
üìä If computational resources are limited, **Na√Øve Bayes is a solid alternative.**  
üîç If decision interpretability is key, **Decision Trees with pruning may improve results.**  
ü§ñ If using deep learning, **LSTM needs hyperparameter tuning & more data** to be competitive.  

## Conclusion
Among traditional machine learning models, **Linear Regression had the best R¬≤ score, meaning it explained the most variance**, while **Random Forest had the lowest MSE, indicating the least absolute error**. However, both models had limited predictive power, suggesting that earthquake magnitude prediction is highly complex and may require more advanced techniques.

The **LSTM model, despite having a higher MSE, is more suited for time-series forecasting** and can capture temporal dependencies better than traditional models. While its error metrics suggest room for improvement, deep learning remains a promising approach for earthquake prediction, particularly with further fine-tuning and additional features.

This project demonstrates that while machine learning can provide some insights into earthquake magnitude prediction, **deep learning models like LSTM offer a more scalable and adaptable solution** for capturing the complex patterns of seismic activity.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional seismic features such as location coordinates and fault-line data.
- Use attention mechanisms for better feature weighting.
- Experiment with Transformer-based models for improved predictions.
