# EarthquakeMagPredictor
Project for Semester 8 - KIIT (CSE)
# Earthquake Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting earthquake magnitudes using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Two different models were implemented:
1. Traditional machine learning models such as **Linear Regression, SVM, and Random Forest**.
2. A **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to forecast earthquake magnitudes based on historical seismic data.

The datasets used for this project were sourced from:
- **Notebook 1 Dataset**: [SOCR Data: California Earthquake Data](https://socr.ucla.edu/docs/resources/SOCR_Data/SOCR_Data_Earthquakes_Over3.html)
- **Notebook 2 Dataset**: [IRIS Seismic Data](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/)

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies, listed in `requirements.txt`:

```
pandas~=2.2.1
matplotlib~=3.8.3
seaborn~=0.13.2
plotly~=5.19.0
numpy~=1.26.4
scikit-learn~=1.4.1.post1

```

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notebook 1: Traditional Machine Learning Models
### Data Preprocessing:
- The dataset was loaded and preprocessed (handling missing values, normalizing magnitudes and depth).
- Time-ordered splitting (80% training, 20% testing) was applied.

### Models Implemented:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

### Results:
| Model | Mean Squared Error (MSE) | RÂ² Score |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Linear Regression | 0.1879 | 0.0235 |
| SVM | 0.6981 | -2.6273 |
| Random Forest | 0.0126 | -0.1832 |

## Notebook 2: Deep Learning with LSTM
### Data Preprocessing:
- The dataset was processed similarly to Notebook 1.
- An LSTM-based sequence model was built to predict earthquake magnitudes.

### Model Architecture:
- **LSTM Layers**: Two stacked LSTM layers.
- **Dense Layer**: Fully connected layer for magnitude prediction.
- **Concatenation**: Merging depth information with LSTM output.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Optimizer**: Adam.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using `keras_tuner`.

### Results:
| Metric | Value |
|-------------|----------------|
| MSE | 0.9675 |
| RMSE | 0.9836 |
| MAE | 0.8224 |

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations:
- **Actual vs Predicted Magnitudes**: Scatter and trend plots comparing real and predicted values.
- **Prediction Error Analysis**: Line plots showing prediction errors.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earthquake-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd earthquake-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run **Earthquake_Prediction_Project.ipynb** for traditional ML models.
5. Run **LSTM_Model.ipynb** for LSTM-based deep learning predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how both traditional and deep learning models can be applied to earthquake prediction. While traditional ML models yielded poor performance, the LSTM-based model showed promise in capturing trends in seismic data.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional seismic features such as location coordinates and fault-line data.
- Use attention mechanisms for better feature weighting.
- Experiment with Transformer-based models for improved predictions.
